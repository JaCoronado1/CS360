The purpose of this appplication is to make an android application in which a user would be able to search for items add items and update the items as well.

it was important to incorporate many features for this appliation such as a login screen which would verify what users are logging and also if they had an issue logging in a user would have the ability 
to reset their password if needed and also retrive a user name if it is forgotten.

To code this application it was necessary to break down the task as much as possible and to make seperate classes for the features to keep it clean and easy to identify issues.
While coding it was important to test and run the code to make sure that the application does run error free. During this process it was easy to see where there maybe issues.

When making this application it was important to make sure the U/I was fitting I had to change the size and the layout from a prevoius layout that I had to incorporate the needed features.
I thinnk for me after struggling with the XML files I have a good grip on how they should be used and how to customize the layout of the application.
